===== USAGE NOTES =====

 1. Rates are quoted ONLY for those methods that are checked.

 2. USPS minimum Length, Width and Height are only included for obtaining International Rate Quotes. Dimensions are NOT supported by this shipping module.
 3. There are now separate settings for Domestic and International.
 4. Minimum Weight and Maximum Weight per shipping method will enable/disable the methods based on the total weight.
 5. Handling has both Global National and International fees per Box or per Order. In addition, individual Handling Fees per order can be added for each shipping method.
 6. Extra Service charges for National and International are available where applicable.
 7. Quotes can be obtained based on Retail or Online pricing.
 8. Debug logs can be saved to the /logs directory, when enabled to review quote request sent to USPS and quote received back from USPS.
 9. For US shipping, First Class has a filter to help prevent multiple First Class quotes from being displayed, due to the way USPS responds back to quote requests for multiple First Class methods.
    Enable USPS First-Class filter for US shipping. This will use the 1st quote from USPS for First-Class and skip other First-Class methods to help avoid duplicate display quotes
    NOTE: using weight minimum/maximum is usually a better method to control this
10. USPS Options for the Display Transit Times may slow down quotes
11. USPS Domestic Transit Time Calculation Mode
    a) NEW: uses whatever the new option "ShipDate" returns. This is something new added by USPS on July 28, and the way this Version J5 module implements it causes it to
       ask USPS to quote based on "ship this item today if quoting before 2pm, else ship tomorrow".
       This may affect the number of days you see, and maybe that's why you were confused about the meaning of this "NEW" option.

    b) OLD: uses the older legacy APIs (multiple separate calls to each Service) to get dates. This is how it worked before July 28.
       At this point there is no indicator whether this option will still be supported by USPS for much longer.

       NOTE: If blank from USPS, uses CUSTOM values from parseDomesticLegacyAPITransitTimeResults() in usps.php

    c) CUSTOM: uses only what's hard-coded into usps.php in the parseDomesticTransitTimeResults() function. Completely ignores whatever USPS provides.
       NOTE: Ignored for International destinations.
